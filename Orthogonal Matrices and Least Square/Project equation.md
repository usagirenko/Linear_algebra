# $A^TA\hat{x}=A^Tb$

>***If  A is a rectangular matrix, Ax = b is often unsolvable. The matrix $A^TA$ will help us find a vector $\hat{x}$ that comes as close as possible to solving Ax = b.***

- come from the orthogonal property : $x^Ty=y^Tx=0$
- since the error is perpendicular to the column space,Error(**e**)$=b-p=b-Ax$
- so $A^T(b-Ax)=0,A^TA\hat{x}=A^Tb$.
